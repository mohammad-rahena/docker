# 🐳 Docker Internship Assignment

This repository contains a collection of practical Docker tasks completed as part of an internship assignment. Each folder represents a separate topic or concept, with step-by-step instructions, commands, and example files.

##  What’s Inside

- **01-intro**: Basics of containerization and Docker fundamentals
- **02-install-run**: Docker installation and running containers from images
- **03-dockerhub**: Using Docker Hub, image registries, and multi-stage builds
- **04-multimethods**: Building Docker images using Dockerfile and running containers
- **05-push-pull**: Pushing and pulling images from Docker Hub and Azure Container Registry
- **06-network**: Creating custom Docker bridge networks and container communication
- **07-volume**: Docker volumes and persistent storage across containers
- **08-compose**: Multi-container apps with Docker Compose and basic security best practices

##  How to Run

Each folder contains:
- A `README.md` with steps and explanation
- Dockerfiles, Compose files, or code examples as needed

You can run each example independently using standard Docker CLI commands.

##  Goal

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical understanding of Docker concepts through small, focused tasks — from getting started with containers to managing multi-container applications.
